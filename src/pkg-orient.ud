    (title "Overview")

    (para "This package provides a set of Ada bindings to the "
      (link-ext "http://opengl.org" "OpenGL") " API."))

  (subsection
    (title "Design")

    (para "The package splits the " (item package "OpenGL") " API
      into several Ada packages, providing strongly typed versions
      of of the original C functions. The strongly typed versions
      use enumeration types and floating point subtypes to prevent
      the passing of invalid parameters to the API.")

    (para "The package also provides direct access to the original "
      (item package "OpenGL") " functions via the "
      (link "opengl_thin" "OpenGL.Thin") " package. This package is
      generated directly from the OpenGL specifications, for
      correctness."))

  (subsection
    (title "Documentation")

    (para "This documentation should be considered supplementary
      to the " (link-ext "http://www.opengl.org/documentation/"
      "OpenGL documentation and specifications") ". The user is
      expected to have knowledge of the " (item package "OpenGL") " API.
      This documentation makes no attempt to describe the original API
      and only documents the new Ada subprograms and their relation to
      the original C functions."))
